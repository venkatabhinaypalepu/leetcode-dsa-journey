Problem: Majority Element
Difficulty: Easy
Date: 26-02-2026

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        counts = {}
        n = len(nums)
        for num in nums:
            counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1
            if counts[num] > n // 2:
                return num
